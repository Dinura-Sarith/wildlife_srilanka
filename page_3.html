        <h1>Indigenous species in Sri Lanka</h1>
        <section class="content5">
            <p>Sri Lanka, an island nation in South Asia, is home to a diverse array of indigenous animals, many of which are endemic, meaning they are found nowhere else in the world. The country's unique geographical features, including forests, wetlands, and coastal areas, contribute to this biodiversity.</p>

        <h2>1.Sri Lankan Elephant</h2>
        <section class="content6">    
            <img src="img\52A2471-Sumedha-768x512.jpg">
            <p>The majestic Sri Lankan elephant is one of the most beautiful in the world. These gentle giants have been an integral part of the country since ancient times, crucial to the royal entourage, religious festivals, and processions.A herd of elephants, which includes the females and babies, is usually led by the alpha female (or the oldest female in the herd), while the males leave the pack once they are of a certain age, roaming the surrounding areas on their own.While herds of elephants can be found in almost all of the national parks in Sri Lanka, the best national parks to see elephants on the island are Minneriya and Udawalawe national parks.</p>

        <h2>2.Sloth Bear</h2>
        <section class="content6">    
            <img src="img\Sloth-Bear-1.jpg">
            <p>Sloth bears are elusive shy creatures. They are among the most ferocious of bears found anywhere in the world, however if you come across one of these cute creatures while travelling in Yala or Wilpattu National Parks, do not fear; they have never been known to show any type of aggression towards travellers or their vehicles. Although known to be shy, they are not beyond providing you with some entertainment with a few antics of their own, as they relax and unwind along the roadside or roll around in the dust to keep cool.</p>

        <h2>3.Sambar Deer</h2>
        <section class="content6">    
            <img src="img\27276_medium.jpg">
            <p>The Sri Lankan sambar deer are gentle creatures found roaming around the hillsides of Horton Plains and other colder areas of the country. They are quite heavy and have thick brown fur to ward off the cold, and beautiful antlers that reach to the heavens, although it is only the males who grow antlers. The best times to see them are in the early morning and late evening when they come out of hiding to forage. At other times, they stay away from the hot sun, preferring to lie under a shady tree until the sun goes down and it is time for a snack.</p>

        <h2>4.Toque Macaque</h2>
        <section class="content6">    
            <img src="img\TOQUE-MACAQUE-shutterstock_1558589447-RESIZE.jpg">
            <p>The toque macaque is a reddish-brown-coloured Old World monkey endemic to Sri Lanka, where it is known as the rilewa or rilawa. Its name refers to the whorl of hair at the crown of the head, reminiscent of a brimless toque cap.They live in troops, sometimes numbering up to 20 members, the dry zone subspecies has earned the nickname “temple monkey” as they are commonly sighted in the Cultural Triangle of Sri Lanka, where many ancient monuments including temples are situated. This subspecies has been the subject of one of the longest behavioural studies of any primate species conducted in the world.</p>

        <h2>5.Purple Faced Langur</h2>
        <section class="content6">    
            <img src="img\DSC_3288.JPG">
            <p>The purple-faced langur, also known as the purple-faced leaf monkey, is a species of Old World monkey that is endemic to Sri Lanka. The animal is a long-tailed arboreal species, identified by a mostly brown appearance, dark face and a very shy nature. The species was once highly prevalent, found in suburban Colombo and the "wet zone" villages (areas with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, whilst rain deluges occur during the monsoon seasons), but rapid urbanization has led to a significant decrease in the population level of the monkeys.</p>
